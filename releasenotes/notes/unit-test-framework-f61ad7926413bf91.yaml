    A backend mock has been added that enables better unit testing of the
    Ironic API service and other Ironic-UI components. The mock utilizes
    Angular $httpbackend handlers to intercept requests targeted at the
    Ironic-UI server-side REST endpoints, and returns simulated responses.
  - |
    A number of unit tests have been developed that illustrate the use
    of the backend mock.
  - |
    Although the backend mock is a work in progress, enough
    functionality already exists to support test development for
    the current set of in-progress features.
